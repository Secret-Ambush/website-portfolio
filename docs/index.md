### Hello there!

Aspiring to immerse myself in the dynamic and ever-expanding technology realm, I pursued a BE degree at BITS. My profound passion lies in connecting the principles of computer science with diverse engineering fields, ranging from robotics to electrical circuitry. The profound impact of computer science, particularly evident during the pandemic, has fueled my inspiration to actively engage and contribute to this vast domain.

Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently excelled, earning recognition and the prestigious *UAE Golden Visa* in the distinguished student category. Beyond academics, I have proudly represented my school on numerous occasions across diverse platforms, gaining invaluable experiences along the way.

I'm currently a 3rd Year at BITS Pilani, where I'm studying Computer Science Engineering.  Check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SGU5yzvUCoerahRR5SHKeq4AAeRmRhgd/view?usp=sharing) here.
